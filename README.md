A basic and straight forward and universal serial monitor. The main idea is to create a program that can run on Windows (from version 95 up to the latest and greatest), Linux, and Mac OS. This way, no matter how old your machine is (usually quite old when you have a industrial environment) you can run this piece of software in it to test serial stuff.
