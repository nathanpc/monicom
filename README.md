A basic and straight forward and universal serial monitor. Something a bit
better than the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
serial monitor, more professional, but not as daunting as
[RealTerm](https://realterm.sourceforge.io/). Also this program aims to be
cross-platform, so you can have the same serial experience no matter which
OS you are using.
